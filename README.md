This is a dummy implementation of the [Eventually](https://github.com/Rotorsoft/eventually-monorepo) library

It follows the step-by-step guide on the `README.md`, but changing the domain from hotel rooms to pokémon

It is the same example, only names were changed to force me to think and not just copy/paste anything.

❗this example assumes there's only 1 of each pokémon, as if they were unique hotel rooms
